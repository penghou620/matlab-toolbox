<p>Hopefully, a person could start using the MATLAB Strobe Demo
tool without any need to read these help files. Features were designed to be
intuitive and familiar to those with basic computer experience.</p>

<p>For those who like to read the manual, this section will give you the minimum
you need to get started and be comfortable with the use of the GUI.</p>

<p>First, if you have not already done so, follow the information given in the
<SPAN class="TextHighlight">Installation</SPAN> section to install and start the
MATLAB Strobe Demo tool.</p>

<p>

<ol>
  <li>To begin with, set the motor's frequency, this will determine the angular frequency of the arrow.
  You can set the frequency in <em>Hz</em> by using the <strong>Motor Frequency (Hz)</strong> edit-box.
  Another way to set the motor's frequency is, you can use the <strong>Motor rotations/min</strong> 
  slider/edit-box to set the motor frequency in revolutions per minute. You should be able to see
  change in <strong>Samples</strong> plot and the corresponding <strong>Spectrums</strong>.</li>

  <li>You can also set the strobe's flashing rate at which the disk's arrow is sampled. This can be done
  using the <strong>Flash Frequency (Hz)</strong> edit-box at bottom-right of the GUI, which sets the
  sampling frequency in <em>Hz</em>.  The flashing rate can be alternatively specified in flashes per minute
  by using the <strong>Flashes/min</strong> slider/edit-box.</li>
  
<li>Once the motor frequency and the strobe's flashing frequency has been set, you can use keyboard
  keys <strong>k</strong> and <strong>l</strong> to change the flashing rate and observe changes made to
  <strong>Samples</strong> and <strong>Spectrums</strong> plots. If the flashing frequency selected is 
  less than the Nyquist rate (2*Motor Frequency), then you will see the text <span         class="TextHighlight">ALIASING!</span> displayed in the <strong>Discrete Time Spectrum</strong> plot, 
  indicating aliasing.</li>

  <li>You can also toggle the <strong>Fine</strong> radio button to change the step-size when advancing 
  the sliders.</li>

  <li>Another useful feature of the Demo is its color-coded plots. 
  <UL>
    <li>If the frequency of the motor lies within the range indicated by
    the 'yellow' strip, then the arrow is not aliased.</li>
    <li>Un-aliased frequency components are marked in 'blue' and the aliased
    components are marked in 'red', in the spectrum plots.</li>
    <li>When Aliasing occurs, such that the rotation of the arrow appears to reverse its
    direction, then the text <span class="TextHighlight">ALIASING!</span> is displayed 
    in the <strong>Discrete Time Spectrum</strong> plot axis.</li>
  </UL>
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="left">That's it!&nbsp; You now understand the basics of how to use the
MATLAB Strobe Demo tool; For a more in depth description of the theory behind 
Strobe Demonstration see the <SPAN
class="TextHighlight">Theory</SPAN> section. The <SPAN
class="TextHighlight">Controls</SPAN> and <SPAN
class="TextHighlight">Menus</SPAN> sections provide a description of the various
elements in the user interface.</p>
